A simple Calculator for a course project. It was a GREAT experience of headache because I'm not allowed to use eval(). I had to use Shunting Yard Algorithm which took me a decade to learn how to use correctly. I learned a lot about implementations of Algorithms and how tokens actually work!!
It was a nice experience overall!!
